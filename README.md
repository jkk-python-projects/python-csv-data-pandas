# Python CSV Data with Pandas

This repository contains a Python practice project to handle CSV data using the Python Pandas library.

## Description

The project is about how to read, write, and manipulate CSV data using the powerful Pandas library in Python.

The project includes the following files:

- `main.py`: The main Python script that demonstrates various operations on CSV data using Pandas.
- `squirrel_count.csv`: A sample CSV file containing data about squirrel counts.
- `weather_data.csv`: A sample CSV file containing weather data.

## Features
